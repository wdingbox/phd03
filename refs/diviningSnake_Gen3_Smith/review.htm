    The Divining Snake: Reading Genesis 3
    in the Context of Mesopotamian
    Ophiomancy

    This article argues that the snake in Gen 3 is best understood within a cultural
    context that included Mesopotamian ophiomancy. Reading the snake in Gen 3
    in this context leads to understanding Hebrew y71 210 as meaning "good fortune
    and ill fortune.? The article reviews ophiomancy as reflected in omen series
    Summa Alu ina mèlè Sakin and other Mesopotamian omen and ritual texts. Of
    the hundreds of snake omens, forty some deal with the ominous behavior of
    snakes acting in the presence of a man and a woman. These omens provide
    instructive parallels for the interaction of the snake in Gen 3 and the first couple.
    They also provide evidence for the cultural context of the snake's role as a com-
    municator of YHWH's mind if not YHWH's will. With several well-attested
    examples of polysemy and alliteration in Gen 2-3, ancient authors and readers
    no doubt perceived an unstated relationship between vm ("snake") and vin
    ("divination"). Hebrew 310 and y7 have overlapping semantic ranges with Akka-
    dian damqu and lemuttu. Good fortune and ill fortune are within those over-
    lapping ranges. Scholars have long noted parallels between Gen 2-3 and other
    Mesopotamian traditions, most notably Gilgamesh and Adapa.
    The snake, N1M, of Gen 3 has long been a crux. How should one understand
    this snake? In his commentary on Genesis, Umberto Cassuto listed and rejected a
    variety of candidate answers to this question. Among his rejected answers was
    "serpents used for divining' future events." In this article, I argue that Cassuto and
    others have passed over the interpretive virtues of such an understanding too
    lightly.' I argue that the snake and its message are best understood within a cultural

    context that includes Mesopotamian ophiomancy. Drawing on omens from Summa
    Álu ina mèlê Sakin (hereafter Summa Alu) and other Mesopotamian divination
    texts, I will first illustrate and explain the Akkadian evidence; I will then discuss
    how this evidence might inform our understanding of the snake in Gen 3; and,
    finally, I will justify such an understanding by showing that Mesopotamian ophio-
    mancy was part of the cultural substrate out of which Gen 3 emerged. I delay this
    last topic to the end of the article because it depends, in part, on evidence and
    arguments developed in the discussion of the first two topics.
    Mesopotamian Optoancy
    Our most extensive source for Mesopotamian ophiomancv is the approxi-
    matelv five hundred snake omens witnessed on tablets 22 through 26 of the Akka-
    dian omen series Summa Alu. This evidence is supplemented by several additional
    snake omen collections that are not readilv associated with series Summa Alu but
    are clearly in the same tradition.? The evidence for Mesopotamian ophiomancy is

    2Rosel Pientka-Hinz provides a detailed account of snakes in Mesopotamian literature
    ("Schlange A", RIA 12:202-18). Of particular importance to our discussion is his review of Meso-
    potamian snake omens and exorcism literature (DD. 212-13). Unless otherwise noted, I have used

    we have medical texts with prescrintions for curing snakehites (note in this regard Num 21.5-6
    and, from Ugarit, KTU1.100 = RS 24.244); references to snake-charming rituals (compare Jer 8:17
    and Ooh 10:11): fables (Etana Legend: Beniamin R. Foster. Before the Muses: An Antholoov of

    further augmented by a number of namburbi rituals and prayers against negative
    portents of ominous snake behavior." Summa Alu, as preserved in multiple manu-
    scripts from the Ashurbanipal Library and elsewhere, once consisted of as many as
    120 numbered tablets.4 Most of these tablets, while often fragmentary, are extant.
    The series as a whole deals with terrestrial events-everything from the location of
    cities to animal and insect behavior, to fungal patterns, to plants, to things that
    might happen during ritual processions." Each tablet contains approximately one
    hundred omens-some significantly fewer, some more. The omens are structured
    as conditional clauses (if P then Q). Most often each omen has but a single, some-
    times complex, protasis and a single apodosis. However, a number of the omens
    have several apodoses. In a few cases multiple apodoses contradict one another.6

    and Assur, tablets from series Summa Älu have been discovered at Kalhu, Babylon, Borsippa, and
    Sippar. Precursors, clear excerpts from series Summa Alu, and very similar omens that are not so
    clearly associated with the canonical series are known from many other sites. These tablets range
    in date from Old Babvlonian Summa Alu precursors (early to mid-second millennium BCE) to
    228 BCE.
    >Other such series include Summa Izhu. on malformed births: Enuma Anu Enlil, or
    meteorology and astrology; Barûtu (manzazu, padanu, and pan takalti) on extispicy; digiqu, on

    Occasionally an omen or group of omens will be followed by an apotropaic proce-
    dure to mitigate undesirable portents. The overwhelming majority, if perhaps not
    quite all Summa Alu omens, are omina oblativa, "casually met with omens,"
    aS
    opposed to omina impetrativa, "sought out omens" Frederick Cryer calls such
    omens "surprise encounters.?" Summa Alu is organized by protasis theme. Tablets
    22-63 deal with the ominous behavior of land animals in general (zoomancy), and
    tablets 64-79 deal with the ominous behavior of birds (ornithomancv).& Tablets
    22-26 are devoted to the ominous behavior of snakes. No part of Summa Alu tablets
    27-29 has been identified with certainty. Neither their incipits nor their contents
    are known. For this reason, it is uncertain if one or more of these tablets also con-
    tained snake omens. The first omen in the ophiomancy subseries of Summa Alu
    (tablet 22:1) reads:
    DIS ina ITIBARA, UD.I.KAM, NA la-am TA GIS.NA, GIR,-54, ana KI GAR-nu
    MUS TA HABRUD.DA E,-ma la-am ma-am-man IGI LU, IGI LU, BI in SAg MU

    IT1.3KAM, uS-ta-pa-as,-Saq-maTI-uh?
    If, on the first of (the month of) Nisanu, before a man has put his foot out of bed
    onto the ground, a snake comes out of a hole and, before anyone sees (it), it sees
    the man, that man will die within that year; if that man desires to live, he should
    ??? (his) head, (and) shave his cheeks; he will suffer for three months but he will
    live.
    Notice that this first snake omen contains a procedure for mitigating the full force of
    the misfortune that the omen's apodosis entails. If one follows the procedure, there
    will be three months of suffering, but death will be avoided. While we do not always
    know the mitigating ritual or procedure, it appears that, given enough time, incon-
    venience, and expense, many unfavorable portents could be avoided or deflected with
    appropriate ritual. Following this first snake omen are twenty-two omens involving
    various snake activities in the month of Nisanu and then fourteen omens involving
    snake activities during several subsequent months. Like the majority of the omens in
    Summa Alu, these omens lack an associated mitigating procedure.
    The central thesis of this article depends on the thematic breadth of Summa
    Alu snake omens rather than on any particular omen that exhibits a direct parallel
    will have no rival or (lu) a commoner, his calamity will be removed;" or strikingly 22:38, "[If on]
    the day he prays, a snake slithers under a man and lies down [ ... ]; alternatively (KIMIN), his
    property will be taken away; alternatively (KIMIN), he will eat bounteous food"

    ° Following the convention of CAD, I read the BAD sign UG, rather than UG,. On the
    uncertainty of the meaning of hararu, see CAD H, 91-92 (hararu A). BM 129092, an unpublished
    commentary, reads ú-har-ra-ár, perhaps related to hararu, "to dig or groove." See Freedman, If a

    with the activity of the snake in Gen 3. None exhibits such a direct parallel. There-
fore it is necessary to document this thematic breadth. Being generally less complex
and less lacunose than many omens, omens 52-92 of Summa Alu tablet 22 provide
a useful sequence to further this necessity. The following is but a sample.
22:52
DIS MUS and IGI NA i-mu-ut SUB-at EN KA-SU, IGI-mar
If a snake dies in front of a man, he will see the downfall of his
adversarv.
22:53
DIS MUS and IGI NA it-ta-pa-as EN KA-su, GAZ-ak
Is a snake lops about (strikes in all directions?) in front of a man, he
will kill his adversary.
22:54
DIS MUS an IGI NA iz-qu-up lit-ti u ki-sit-ti Su
If a snake stands in front of a man-victory and booty of conquest.
22:55
DiS MUS ana IGI NA DU.DU mi-lum, ana KUR
If a snake wanders about in front of a man-irrigation of the land. 10
22:56
[DIS] MUS ana IGI NA KAS,-um KUR-ad, A, AS,
I a snake runs in front of a man-_attainment of decire
But not all the omens in this sequence have positive portents. Most do not. For
example,
22:64
DIS MUS ana IGI NA sa-dir NA BI NIG,.GA-Su, i-gam-mar ina NU
DUG, lib-bi DU.MES
If a snake is regularly in front of a man, that man will deplete his
resources (property); he will live (go about) unhappily.
Notice that 22:52 shows polysemy: IGI, pan(u), "face," and IGI, immar (amäru), "he
will see? The play between IGI, pan(u), "face," and IGI, immar, "he will see," provides
a weak hermeneutical connection between the protasis and the apodosis of this
omen. The scribe did not save a single sign by writing IGI with the phonetic comple-
ment mar in 22:52. While still following convention, the scribe saved, at best, a
couple of wedges. Far from a majority of omens evidence such wordplay. But poly-
semy, polyphony, and even more complex linguistic interrelationships do occur in
Mesopotamian omens more often than can be accounted for by chance alone. Scott
Noegel and Eckart Frahm, among others, have demonstrated that such wordplay
often functions as a hermeneutical link between an omen's protasis and its apo-
dosis."I As both Noegel and Frahm argue, the ability to draw inferences from

polysemy and polyphony was a scribal virtue in the ancient Near East. I will address
polysemy in the Hebrew of Gen 3 when I consider the possible play between
Hebrew wry ("snake") and vra ("practice divination") along with its nominal
forms below.
Over forty extant omens from Summa Alu involve a man, a woman, and one
or more snakes. Many are too fragmentary for detailed study. Representative of the
more readable omens of this type are:

As Summa Alu 23:30 witnesses, not all such omens have negative portents. Some,
like 23:23, even portend the birth of a male child.

If a snake eats itself, causing tooth (induced) [tail(?)] pain(?) by its

14 This reconstruction is but a suggestion.
15Ig-dar-ru is problematic. Freedman tentatively suggests that it might be a Gt of gerù, "to
be hostile" (If a City, 2:39).
I° It is not obvious how one should understand zU,.GIG NA. On zu,.gig (toothache) = zakigà,
see za-ki-ga-a in RS 17.155 and duplicate (Ugaritica,
vol. 5, MRS 16 [Paris: Geuthner, 1968],
17:36). Here I take it to mean a pain caused by a tooth. While not without problems, I read NA as
the Sumerian 3rd sg. locative pronoun. Exactly how one should gloss it in Akkadian 1s unclear.
Note ni-e NA
= Su-u (EA IV 105; see CAD S3, 153) and na-a NA = Su-u (A IV/2:223', 222).
Freedman, perhaps wisely, simply reads ka mi na without attempting to interpret the text (If a
City, 2:38). My restoration of KUN = zibbati, "tail," is completely speculative. Freedman reads the
omen, DIS MUS rA-man-su, 1k-kal GAR-un ka mi na ... Ina KA-SU, DAM NA NITA U,.TU (Ifa City
2:38)
38
Journal of Biblical Literature 134, no. 1 (2015)
In other cases the portent seems to me particularly strange and unexpected. For
example 24:1:
DIS MUS ina UGU GIS.NA, NA NA,-iS DAM LU, IGI.MES-Sa, GUR.
MES-ma DUMU.MES-Sa, ana KU,.BABBAR SUM-in
If a snake lies on a man's bed, the man's wife will be distracted and sell
her children for silver.
What we see in these omens is a rather systematic listing of a range of possible
snake activities that were each thought to portend some outcome or outcomes.
While most portend separation, divorce, dismantling of the household, even death,
others portend positive outcomes.
In addition to Summa Alu, there are a number of other witnesses to Meso-
potamian ophiomancy. Nils Heeßel published a modern edition of four tablets
from Assur that contain snake omens with the same formal structure and general
content as Summa Alu snake omens but are not obviously part of that series.I VAT
10116 + 10145:8 provides an example,
DIS MUS. MES ina E, DINGER ana m|a-glal SUB.SUB.MES-nils sa,
NIR.DA-a SI.A ana! B, DINGER! ana Ez.GAL KU;-ME-ni
If snakes often(?) fall in a temple, those who are extremely guilty will
enter the temple (or) the palace before me(?).
The omens in lines 8-14 of this tablet plus a few seemingly out-of-place omens deal
with ominous behavior of snakes in a temple. Other omens deal with snakes in a
man's house, in his path, in a field, and, more generally, on the ground. VAT 10523,
also from Assur, witnesses a few omens involving a man, a woman, and a snake.
Rev. I:11, for example:
[DIS Mu]S a-na bi-rit NITA U MUNUS SUB-ut lu i+ na-bit, lu ina
ze-nu-ti TAR.MES
If a snake falls between a man and a woman: either he will flee or they
will separate in hatred.
While this omen is very similar in content, it is not witnessed in these words in any
extant tablet in Summa Älu. We see in these texts, as well as in the more obvious
17 See Heeßel, Divinatorische Texte, 1:13 (VAT 10116 + 10145), 14 (VAT 10523 + A 10) and
15 (VAT 10805). Heeßel's tablets 9 (VAT 10481 + VAT 10905b + VAT 12918 etc.), 11 (A 453 +
A 536 + A 2410 + A 2438), and 12 (VAT 13812 +
VAT 13827) reflect duplicates and/or excerpts
of varying lengths from Summa Alu tablets 22-25.
18 The Akkadian word represented by this group is no doubt plural and likely a -tan- form,
"continuously fall." On SUB.MES-ni, see CT 29:48-48, "Stars fell repeatedly(?) (SUB.SUB.MES-ni)
from the sky"; A. Leo Oppenheim, The Interpretation of Dreams in the Ancient Near East, With a

Summa Alu duplicates and excerpts from Assur, a dynamic ophiomancy tradition
that extended from before the Neo-Assyrian period. As I will show, the Mesopota-
mian ophiomancy tradition continued from as early as the Old Babylonian period
well into late antiquity.
Namburbi rituals and associated prayers are another source for understanding
Mesopotamian ophiomancy. Namburbi rituals are apotropaic in that they were
used to deflect or mitigate the negative portents of omens. Snake activity in the
context of human activity had consequences, lives were thought to be changed
sometimes in rather dramatic ways. But various gods, notably Shamash, if properly
approached, could set aside these negative portents. VAT 5 witnesses a prayer of
the type found in namburbi rituals:
O Shamash, king of heaven and earth, Lord of truth and justice, Lord of the
Anunna-gods, Lord of the spirits of the dead, whose consent no god can change,
whose command cannot be altered, O Shamash, reviving the dead (and) releas
ing the captive is in your hands.
O Shamash, I, your servant, so-and-so, son of so-and-so, whose personal god is
Marduk and (whose) personal goddess is Zarpanitum, stand before you. I seize
vour hem
On account of the evil of a snake, which I saw enter my house and hunt, I am afraid,
anxious, and constantly in fear.
From this evil save me, that I may proclaim your greatness, (and) praise your
glories, (and that) those who see me may sound your praises, (and) forever praise
your glories!
No extant Summa Alu omen exactly matches the case of a snake seen entering
someone's house and hunting prey. Summa Alu 23:106 mentions a snake entering
someone's house resulting in a negative portent, "If a snake enters a man's house,
that house will be abandoned," and several omens address snakes hunting specific
kinds of prey.' But none mentions a snake both entering a house and hunting. The
ritual associated with this prayer is unknown. VAT 5 contains only the prayer: 20
However, more complete namburbi rituals against the evil of a snake witness a
variety of procedures.?' It is possible to glean an idea of the ritual of which the

namburbi rituals (Astral Magic, 83 n. 338).

VAT 5 prayer may have been a part from the related text 80-7-19,88.22 This nam-
burbi ritual involves a practitioner drawing water at sunset, mixing barley, emmer,
and lentils with silver and gold. In a secluded place "they" make a reed altar to
Shamash and place bread, honey, and ghee on and around it. Carnelian, lapis lazuli,
and several other stones plus copper, tin, silver, and gold are dipped in oil and made
into a necklace for the supplicant. At this point the tablet becomes nearly unread-
able, but eventually the supplicant recites an incantation similar to VAT 5's prayer.
While closely parallel, the prayer of the 80-7-19,88 namburbi does not appear to
witness exactly the same prayer as does VAT 5.
Scholars have suggested two ways in which ancient Mesopotamian divination
was understood. One understanding was theological. The gods make their will and
mind (or the will and mind of other gods) known to humans through omens. While
no snake omen or narrative concerning a snake omen directly witnesses this or any
other mechanism, we can reasonably surmise a theological mechanism from the
petitions to the gods in namburbi rituals and, by analogy, with other Mesopotamian
divination traditions. For example, it is said of Shamash, in libbi immeri tasattar
sira, "On the exta of a sheep you inscribe the omen."23 A common figure for the
process is of a literate god writing on the media at hand. As we will see in more
detail, "writing" was not the only figure for how the gods communicated their will
and mind.24 Sometimes omens
"spoke!
" Eas response to Enlil's anger about
Atrahasis's learning of the coming flood illustrates another way of expressing a
theological mechanism, "It was not I who disclosed the secret of the great gods. I
caused Atrahasis to have a dream, and so he heard the secret of the gods.?"25 Ea
induced a dream that revealed the secret of the great gods.
But Ea's response can be understood cosmologically as well as theologically.
Ea did not disclose the plans of the gods so much as he allowed Atrahasis to experi-
ence those plans by other means. Ann Jeffers suggests that we should understand
divination within a cosmic framework, "How is anyone able to foretell the future
but in a world where signs, any signs, are part of the whole, and therefore can be
interpreted because the sign incarnates and reflects the whole situation at the
moment when it is read"26 The cosmos aligns with the will and mind of the gods,
modifying the stuff of the world in ways that both the gods and properly trained
humans can understand.
Whatever the mechanism, the Mesopotamians saw human knowledge of divi-
nation as of divine origin. Again we lack explicit evidence in the case of ophio-
mancy. We do have evidence of how humans came to know other forms of

divination. From K.2486 + K.3646 + K.4364 we learn that Shamash and Adad
taught the antediluvian king Enmeduranki divine secrets including several forms
of divination:
Enmeduranki [king of Sippar],
The beloved of Anu, Enlil [and Ea].
Samas and Adad [brought him in]to their assembly,
Samas and Adad [honored him],
Samas and Adad [set him] on a large throne of gold,

Ea],
They gave him the tablet of the gods, the entrails, a secret of heaven and
underworld
They put in his hand the cedar-(rod), beloved of the great gods.
And, in turn, Enmeduranki taught divination to the men of Nippur, Sippar, and
Babylon.27 What Lambert called "A Catalogue of Texts and Authors," reads in part:
[The Exorcists] Corpus; The Lamentation-priests' Corpus; When Anu and
Enlil:
I (If) al Form; Not Completed Months; Diseased Sinews;
(If) the Utterance [of the Mouth]; The King, the Storm(?), whose Aura is
Heroic; Fashioned like An
These are of the mouth of Ha
The other referenced treatises in this ancient catalogue are all assigned to human
origin. While one might wonder about the role of Ea as the direct author of the
referenced texts, it is clear that the author/compiler of this catalogue and of K.2486+
saw the gods as the ultimate source of human knowledge of divination.28
Whether we think in theological or cosmological terms, ophiomancy was
surely an important and pervasive part of Mesopotamian divination. It was first in
order among the omens concerning the behavior of land animals in Summa Alu.
Among the ominous activities of animals in general, only that of birds was more
thoroughly catalogued.
II. THE SNAKE IN GENESIS 3
With this Mesopotamian ophiomancy tradition in mind, I now turn to the
snake in Gen 3. Like omina oblativa, the snake appears unexpectedly and interrupts

the narrative of life in the garden. An important element of that life is the divine
instruction on what can and cannot be eaten (Gen 2:16b-17):
Of every tree of the garden you may eat;
but as for the tree of knowledge of good and bad,
you must not eat of it:
for as soon as you eat it you will certainly die.
The snake engages the woman concerning YHWH's instruction, in due course

The snake communicates the mind. if not the will. of God. As a narrative, none of
this has the form of a Mesopotamian snake omen. It is a different genre. But if we
read these lines in the context of Mesopotamian ophiomancy, we see the role of the
snake for what it is- the theological and/or cosmological vehicle through which
the true mind of God becomes known.
Beyond the negation of the punishment for breaking the divine command,
the snake's speech reveals YHWH's underlying motivation. YHWH worries that
humans will become like gods, 71 210 "y7° ("who know good and bad"). The terms
ur and a10 have traditionallv been understood here as having moral connotations
or, less traditionally, when taken together, as a merism for "everything.29 But look-
ing at the breadth of the semantic ranges of these words and reading them in the
context of divination, "fortune"
and "misfortune" provide more helpful under-
standings. In this light I suggest that y71 I10 MyT' means "those who know the results
of divination" those who know fortune and misfortune, possibly even those who
know the skill of divination
We have alreadv seen that Mesopotamian snake omens can have either good
or bad portents. While this is implicit in the extant snake omens, an extispicy omen
makes this point explicitly.30

If the well-being(?) of the sibti is drawn over the sibti: they speak (DUG;U,
iqbû) of good (SIG, = damqi) and evil (HUL = lemutti); features that are placed
on the right are favorable (damiqtu); (those) on the left are unfavorable (ahitu)
My proposed understanding of 310 and y7 in Gen 3:4, and for that matter in
Gen 2:17, is semantically parallel with this omen's use of damqu and lemuttu when
associated with the position of the SLIM MAS, (Sulum sibti) vis-à-vis another part
of a liver. Damqu and lemuttu have no obvious cognates in Hebrew. However, their
semantic ranges overlap those of Hebrew 310 and y7. The Akkadian cognate of
Hebrew 710 is tübu as a noun, tabu as an adjective. Akkadian damqu and tabu are
equated with each other and with Sumerian si-ig [SA,] in the lexical text A I/4.3
Proverbs 13:21 provides evidence for 110 and y7 meaning good and bad fortune
respectively, "Misfortune [y7] pursues sinners, but the righteous are favorably (310]
rewarded"32 In Job 30:26 we read, "When I expected good fortune [a10], misfor-
tune [y7] came. I hoped for light, but darkness came. These usages are well within
the meaning of the Hebrew. Likewise, My7 in Amos 3:6b, "Can misfortune (77)
come to a town if YHWH has not caused it?" is indicative of misfortune rather than
evil intent or moral deficiency. Passages like Prov 13:21, Job 30:26, and Amos 3:6
do not involve divination. They do show that the semantic ranges of 210 and y7
support the connotations of good and bad fortune. First Kings 22:8, 18, use I10 and
y7 to mean good and bad fortune in a context where prophecy functions much as
does divination--to provide guidance to a king. In a cultural context that included
Mesopotamian ophiomancy, Gen 3 portrays the snake as portentous and in so
doing makes the connection with divination-with knowing favorable and un-
favorable fortune.
Scholarly consensus on the formative period of Gen 2-3 remains elusive. For
example, in recent work, Carol Meyers points to the Iron Age as the origin of these
chapters, while John Van Seters argues that his Yahwistic source, which includes
Gen 2-3, originated in the exilic period; and David Carr argues that much the same

43-44 (CAD T, 20). Patrick R. Bennett considers both Akkadian damqu and tabu to be within the
same semantic range as Hebrew I10 (Comparative Semitic Linguistics: A Manual (Winona Lake,
IN: Eisenbrauns, 1998]). Note that re-e-ú in the Akkadian lexical text Erimhus Bogazkoy A i:37-37

32 Modern understandings of 210 and y7 in Prov 13:21 go back at least to Crawford H. Toy,

1899), 276.
Journal of Biblical Literature 134, no. 1 (2015)
material came out of a process that culminated in the Persian period.33 Of course,
Meyers would concede later developments, and both Van Seters and Carr acknowl-
edge the incorporation of earlier traditions. Because Mesopotamian ophiomancy
traditions continued from long before our Assyrian sources' into, as I will show,
late antiquity, the thesis of this article holds whether one places the date of the
composition of Gen 2-3 as early as the monarchic period or as late as the Persian
period. There are those who would place chs. 2-3 in the Hellenistic period. For
example, based on what he sees as parallels with Berossus's Babyloniaca and other
Hellenistic texts, Russell Gmirkin dates our texts to ca. 273-272 BCE. 35 Because
Mesopotamian-style ophiomancy was known in late antiquity, a Hellenistic date
for the composition of Gen 3 in itself does not argue against the thesis of this article.
However, the specific nature of Gmirkin's argument for the Hellenistic period cer-
tainly renders direct Mesopotamian influence extremely problematic. Conversely,
if the thesis of this article holds, it partially undermines Gmirkin's analysis. In what
follows, I use "early exponents" to indicate those oral proponents, writers, editors,
compilers, commentators, and readers who participated in the formative period of
the text whenever and over whatever period such exponents were active.
Having considered how one might understand the activity of the snake in
Gen 3. I turn to the issue of the snake as the craftiest of field animals
MTV7). Genesis 3:1 tells us, "Now the snake was the craftiest field animal that
YHWH God created." On what basis should we accept this statement? To be sure,
this particular snake was able to dupe the woman: "IX" WM17 ("The snake duped
me"; Gen 3:13 NJPS). This may well indicate that this snake is crafty, but it does not
answer our question about the snake as the craftiest field animal in general. What-
ever motivated the tradition to make this claim may well be lost. However, I suggest
that a pervasive belief in the ominous powers of snakes within a shared culture led
to the claim in Gen 3:1a and to the large number of snake omens in Summa Alu
and elsewhere, as well as to the relatively large number of namburbi rituals against
33 The three scholars cited here are but representative of those who share similarly diverse
thoughts on the non-P material in the Pentateuch. See Meyers, Rediscovering Eve, 66; John Van

the evil of snakes. As already mentioned, of all the animals, only birds--which Gen
2:19 calls "bird(s) of the air," as opposed to "field animals".
are better represented among the Mesopotamian animal divination texts. 36
How did early exponents of Gen 3:1 understand oiny? The LXX glosses the
Hebrew as povuóraos ("sage," "thoughtful," "intelligent").37 Most manuscripts
of Targum Onkelos read D'7y, cognate with Hebrew b17y. Because D'7y is a rather
rare lexeme in Aramaic it is likely the preferred reading as the lectio difficilior. But
several manuscripts of Targum Onkelos read o'3M, "wise."38 All such renderings
point to a semantic range at the union of wise and skillful. 39 It is also possible that
the choice of the Hebrew word Dry was influenced by alliteration with or'y
("naked") in this verse and 717» ("damned") in Gen 3:14. See also D'217Y meaning
"(both) naked" in Gen 2:25. While the text refers to the man and the woman as
naked, it is not much of a stretch to see the snake as TY also. and 717 apply
solely to the snake. While not unambiguously attested, "portentous" appears to be
within the semantic range of Hebrew D17y. Based on the sheer number of Akkadian
snake omens and "portentous" very likely being within the semantic range of
Hebrew D17y, my suggestion, simply put, is that the early exponents of Gen 3 per-
ceived snakes as more portentous than any animal except birds.
Scholars have long remarked on a possible linguistic association between the
most common Hebrew noun for snake, wr], and the verb wr], "practice divina-
tion" along with its nominal reflex Wn] ("divination"), *° Semitists are divided on a
possible cognate relationship between these words." However, a cognitive associa-
tion between WI] and wh] does not require that they be linguistic cognates in the

37 Elsewhere, the Old Greek glosses D19Y with ouverós ("intelligent." "wise," Prov 12:23);
TavoÜpyos ("good sense," Prov 13:16, 14:8, 22:3, 27:4), bpovnos ("purpose," "intention," Job
5:12),
and duvaorela ("power," "domination" Job 15:5). Compare ppóvor ts oi ödeis, "as wise as

38 g'7y is the reading preferred of Alexander Sperber, The Bible in Aramaic: Based on Old
Manuscripts and Printed Texts, 3 vols. (Leiden: Brill, 2004), 1:4 (1235); however, as Sperber notes,
Biblia Hebraica (Lisbon, 1491), Biblia Hebraica (Izar, 1490), and Biblia Sacra Complutensis (1516-
17) read o' ("wise").
39 An association between snakes and wisdom in the ancient Near East has long been
demonstrated. See, e.g., Karen Randolph Joines, "The Serpent in Gen 3' ZAW 87 (1975), 1-
esp. 4-5.

formal sense. Being polysemous and polyphonic as they were written-and, in the
case of the noun wry ("divination") nearly homonymous-is enough to motivate a
cognitive association. I have already mentioned the 1ry ("crafty" V/or°y ("naked" /
7178 ("damned) triplet. In addition, the pairing of D7877 ("the Adam") with anTAn
("the clay"); nuN ("woman") with w' ("man"); and mIn ("Eve") with 'M ("living")
shows a penchant for polysemy and alliteration on the part of the early exponents
of Gen 2-3. That these early exponents would have perceived an association
between Wn1, and wr1, even without its being explicit, is all but certain.
I suggest that among the reasons the early exponents of Gen 2-3 chose to keep
the association between WT} and writ implicit is the biblical prohibition against
unauthorized forms of divination by the followers of Israel's God: Lev 19:26: NS
¡wrin, "you shall not practice divination"; and Deut 18:10: "Let there not be found
among you ….. one who is ... a wnin [diviner].' Or, to quote Num 23:23, "Lo, there
is no augury [VM3] in Jacob, no divining [pop] in Israel" (NJPS). John Hobbins
correctly says,
"The inspection of entrails and the flight of birds has no place in
biblical faith."42 Except in the limited sense argued here, neither does the interpreta-
tion of snake activity. Nevertheless, as Isa 14:29 and Jer 8:17 suggest, in somewhat
different ways, snakes can be messengers of God.43 No tradition forbids what it does
not know.
Apart from our snake, Balaam's jenny is the only animal in the Hebrew Bible
that speaks. She speaks in an unambiguous divination context (Num 22-24). Hav-
ing tried other means of communication, the jenny finally speaks of the divine
messenger that even Balaam, the great seer, could not see. Note that the Akkadian
word used to describe the means of communicating in the extispicy example dis-
cussed above is igbü, "they speak." Just as Balaam's jenny used speech to expose
something God sought to reveal, Gen 3 uses the snake's speech to expose something
that God sought to hide.
III. THE CASE FOR A MESOPOTAMIAN OPHIOMANCY CONTEXT
What warrants my claim that the early exponents of Gen 2- 3 saw in the snake
a reflex of divination informed by Mesopotamian ophiomancy? Three lines of evi-
dence and argument support this claim: First, in other passages, the Hebrew Bible
is certainly cognizant of Mesopotamian divination in general. In Gen 30:27 we read

with regard to oneiromancy.
43 See Charlesworth, Good and Evil Serpent, 437-38. The same can perhaps be said of Moses's
and Aaron's staff, which becomes a snake/crocodile(?) in Exod 4:3 (WM3) and 7:10-13 (piN).




















that Laban learned through divination that YHWH had blessed him. Laban is said
to be an Aramean from Nahor in the Aram-Naharaim (Paddan-aram) region of
northwestern Mesopotamia. The text gives no indication of the type of divination
that Laban used to make this determination. Ezekiel 21:26-27 (21-22) recounts
how Nebuchadnezzar employed belomancy (arrows), teraphim(?), and extispicy to
determine the military course and outcome of his attack on Jerusalem. The resi-
dents of Jerusalem (Ezek 21:28 [23]) regarded this N1v [pop2] pop ("as empty
divination").14 Ezekiel proclaims that in so doing Nebuchadnezzar brought mem-
ory of the Jerusalemites' guilt. Daniel 4 tells of Belshazzar's dream and its interpre.
tation. Daniel 5 recounts an unsolicited omen in the form of writing that an hand
drew on a plaster wall. Belshazzar's sages could not interpret it but Daniel could.
With the possible exception of Nebuchadnezzar's use of divination, the text does
not take a negative stance toward these cases of divination. Yet, also in each of these
cases, the omens are sought by or presented to foreigners rather than Israelites.15
There are certainly misplaced and anachronistic elements in some or all of these
accounts; still, they strongly suggest that the biblical tradition was well aware of
foreign, specifically Mesopotamian, divination.
Second, it is now almost trite to note that the early exponents of Gen 2-3 knew
and were influenced by other Mesopotamian traditions, most notably the Epic of
Gilgamesh. Both Gilgamesh and Gen 2-3 include a plant (bush or tree) of life, and
both accounts feature a snake in a prominent role, though the roles differ in the
two works.46 Scholars have also noted parallels with Adapa.47 David Carr specu-
lates, correctly I think, that the "garden of Eden" story reflects the "central values
44 The use of DOP rather than WM3 is likely due to differing modes of divination. While
certainty is impossible, one might speculate that DOP indicated omina impetrativa while wn.
indicated omina oblativa or something of this nature.
45 Note also Isa 2:6, // 07p» (3)00p], "diviners?] from the East" //
"soothsayers like the Philistines." Representing a somewhat different tradition, the Old Greek of
Isa 2:6 has "their country ... was filled with divinations (x^doviouv] as it had been at the
beginning" [NETS]. The Hebrew Bible also reports on divination among the Moabites (Num
22:7), the Midianites (Num 24:1), the Philistines (1 Sam 6:2, Isa 2:6), and the Egyptians (Gen
40:4b-19 passim). In the context of Egypt, note also Joseph's silver cup, 17 11, "and
he by divination divines with it" (Gen 44:5).

of the Mesopotamian [scribal] curriculum."4$ Becoming a diviner was one of the
"postgraduate" options for the advanced scribe. Given the other well-established
Mesopotamian influences, it should be no surprise that Mesopotamian divination
traditions were part of the cultural substrate that informed the early exponents of
Gen 2-3.
Third, Mesopotamian ophiomancy was known over great chronological and
geographical continua. Mesopotamian ophiomancy traditions originated during
or before the Old Babylonian period'° and continued into late antiquity. Referring
specifically to the prohibition against diviners in Deut 18:10, b. Sanh. 65b says this
about the forbidden wrin, "one who divines"
A Menahesh [wrinl is one who says: So and so's bread has fallen out of his hand;
his staff has fallen out of his hand; his son called after him; a raven screamed after
him, a deer has crossed his path; a serpent [wr3] came at his right hand or a fox
at his left.
Summa Alu witnesses three of these rabbinic examples about which a wman is
concerned. In 79:3 ravens scream; in 23:16-17 snakes are on the right and the left;
and in an excerpt foxes are on the right and left.50 The other examples are well
within the scope of a Mesopotamian diviner's portfolio. There is no evidence that
the rabbis knew Summa Alu or any direct literary successor. Still, as is evident from
the passage quoted above, they knew of those who practiced divination in the
Mesopotamian tradition of Summa Alu; they knew of the type of ophiomancy
witnessed in Summa Alu. As Amar Annus notes, many rabbinic omens clearly have
Mesopotamian origins. Annus cites this omen regarding a snake: "If a snake fell on
the bed, it says: he is poor, but he will end up being rich, if (the woman) is pregnant,
she will give birth to a boy, if she is a maiden, she will marry a great man" (t. Sabb.
6:16).51 Not only were these traditions long lived, they were also very widespread.
By at least the sixth century BCE and likely a century or two earlier, knowledge of
Mesopotamian ophiomancy had spread as far west as Ionia. Homer, Il. 12.200-207,

Álu 22:75, "If a snake falls on a man, a rich man will become poor or a poor man will become rich;
that man will be infected." Cf. Summa Alu 22:76. Summa Alu 22:75 is witnessed in six manuscripts,
including multiple witnesses from Kuyunjik and one from Sultantepe (STT 2: 321 i26).



























Smith: The Divining Snake: Genesis 3

contains a very close parallel with three Summa Alu omens (24:20-22) where a bird
carries and drops a snake.52
The Hebrew Bible's cognizance of Mesopotamian divination, the influence of
other Mesopotamian traditions, and the extent over space and time that Mesopo.
tamian ophiomancy was known all support the thesis that the early exponents of
Gen 2-3 understood the snake within a cultural context that included Mesopota
mian divination traditions. This understanding may well have been nuanced by
other traditions, including native Hebrew traditions, but was not completely con-
cealed by them.53
The well-attested influence of other learned Mesopotamian traditions and the
geographical and chronological range over which Summa Alu-like ophiomancy
was current in antiquity make it all but certain that ophiomancy was part of the
cultural substrate that informed the early exponents of Gen 3. This high probability
is strengthened by the implied play on Vr? ("snake") and wra ("practice divina
tion"); and by the forty-plus omens in Summa Alu whose protases involve a man,
a woman, and a snake. The early exponents of Gen 3 wrote, read, edited, and under-
stood the snake in the context of these Mesopotamian ophiomancy traditions-
traditions that existed in their cultural substrate from at least the Iron Age until late
antiquity. In Gen 2, God wills that humankind not know good and bad fortune.
The snake in Gen 3 frustrates that will. Over time other interpretations came to
overshadow this understanding.
52 See Duane E. Smith, "Portentous Birds Flying West: On the Mesopotamian Origin of
Homeric Bird-Divination" JANER 13 (2013): 49-85. Also note that Herodotus (Hist. 1.78)
mentions snake/horse divination in Lydia. Xenophon writes, "Never put yourself or your army in
danger contrary to snake [iepá] or bird [oiwvous]" (Cyr. 1.6.44). On iepá meaning "snake," see
Aristotle, Hist. an. 607a31, "There is a certain very small snake [öpidov], which some call iepóv
that the really big snakes avoid. One cannot be completely certain of the origin of these later
examples, but each of them would be at home within the Mesopotamian divination tradition
53 For example, passages such as Deut 1:39 and 1 Kgs 3:7-9 imply a merism for "discernment'
in Y71 210 and similar formulations. In addition, both Mesopotamian and Egyptian sources often
associate the snake with immortality. The snake of Gilgamesh XI:309-311 steals the plant that
makes one young and in so doing steals immortality. This association no doubt also colored the
early understanding of the snake in Gen 3. On this see, e.g., Joines, "Snake in Gen 3" 1-3, on both
the Mesopotamian and Egyptian material. I thank an anonymous /BL reviewer for pointing out
these likely additional influences on the early exponent's understanding of both the snake and
its role in Gen 3
